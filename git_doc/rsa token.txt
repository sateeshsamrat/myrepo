step 1. 

 download and install git bash into your local computer according to your operating system

 you can download from official website I have given that the link in the discription



 once you have installed git then Open Git Bash. 

Now



step 2. is generate ssh-key,  this is used for authentication

------------------------------------------------------------

the command is ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "tarique.rkl@gmail.com" and your GitHub email address,

  This will Generate public/private rsa key pair.

  "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location.

  Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): I will recommend enter here something and also remember that then enter again

  Ensure the ssh-agent is running: --  eval $(ssh-agent -s)

  Now Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. --for adding run command  $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

  Now you have to add public SSH key to your GitHub account



  so copy your public key by running this command clip "less then symbol" ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

  Now go to your github account click on your profile icon then go to settings click on SSH and GPG key then click on new SSH-key

  give a title any thing you like then paste your key here control v then click on "add ssh key" then it will ask for one time password

  confirm password,  so we have added key successfully

  Till now whatever I have done you have to do only once for your system



step 3. Now create a new repository,

-----------------------------------

  choose repository name

  Now you have to choose either public or private I am leaving it with default public option

  Now if you want readme.md file then initialize it otherwise leave it then click on "create repository"

  Now leave this screen as it is and go to your local directory where your code is, 

  open git bash in the same directory

  Now initialize git -- git init

  then git add . --- it will add all the file into stash ignore warning

  then git commit -m "first commit" now it will commit all the changes locally

  now add the remote repository url-- git remote add origin git@github.com:Tariqu/test.git

  now we are ready to push our code enter commad ---- git push origin master

  now go to your repository and referesh now you can see all the files and folder here
